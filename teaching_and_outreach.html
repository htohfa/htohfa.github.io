        <p style= "margin-top: 60px;"> I enjoy teaching and have worked as a teaching assistant through my undergraduate career. At the University of California, Riverside, I had the pleasure of teaching introductory physics labs during the Fall of 2022, Winter of 2023, and Spring of 2023 where I had to give short lectures and guide students through the experiments and answer questions as they came up. </p>

        <p>Before that, during my time at undergraduate career, I had the privilege to assist in teaching a variety of advanced classes including Advanced Electromagnetism, Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Advanced Quantum Mechanics, Advanced Classical Mechanics, and Multivariable Calculus.
          I also served as a teaching assistant at Bryn Mawr College for Introductory physics and modern Physics. I also worked as a peer tutor where I worked 1-1 with a student for 100-200 level courses at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>As both a student and a teacher, I've witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by marginalized students in academia. I became acutely aware of the obstacles these students often encounter, a realization that stirred in me a deep resolve to help overcome these barriers.</p>

<p>As part of my commitment to promoting inclusivity and equity in education, I joined the Teaching and Learning Institute at Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges as a student consultant<sup>*</sup>. In this capacity, I worked towards the development of resources aimed at fostering anti-racist and trauma-informed pedagogy, as well as enhancing diversity and inclusion in STEM education. This effort involved designing surveys and researching effective pedagogical practices proven to uncover the "hidden curriculum" and mitigate harm to BIPOC, FGLI, and other marginalized students. The goal was to create a more accessible, inclusive, and equitable learning environment.</p>

<p>The summer of 2020 was a pivotal period in this journey, with the global pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement leading to a surge in societal awareness and demand for change. In response, we developed a publicly accessible webpage that showcased trauma-informed, anti-racist, and equitable approaches to teaching and learning. Uniquely, this resource was created from the students' perspectives. We drew upon this resource to engage with faculty groups on their home campuses, facilitating conversations across a ten-college collaborative, and hosting weekly dialogues among faculty, staff, and students from the participating institutions.</p>

<p>This collective effort was not only impactful but also recognized, as we were proud finalists for the POD Innovation Award. For me, it underscored the transformative power of a dedicated community committed to challenging the status quo and pioneering a more inclusive approach to education.</p>


        <p>These experiences have collectively reinforced my belief in the importance of accessibility in education. I firmly believe that everyone, regardless of their background, should have an equal opportunity to learn, grow, and achieve their potential. This belief drives my ongoing commitment to teaching, tutoring, and consulting roles, where I can contribute to making education more accessible and equitable.</p>
