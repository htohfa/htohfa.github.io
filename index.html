        My name is Hurum Maksora Tohfa. I am a gradute student in physics with an interest in cosmology. I am currently working with Professor <a href="https://sbird.github.io">Simeon Bird</a>. 
        We are exploring whether wavelet scatter transform can provide better ways for constraining cosmological parameters. Before that, I worked with 
        Professor <a href="https://danielgrin.net">Daniel Grin</a> at Haverford College throughout my undergradute career. I analyzed time and spatial variation of 
        the fine structure constant. I have also previously worked with Professor Michael McDonald at Massachussetts Institute of Technology and at Microsoft research for a summer. You can find descriptions of 
        all the projects I have worked on in my homepage.

        
        Since I have been in school most of my life, most of my time is spent doing school work or research. When I have free time, I enjoy solving puzzles (physics related or not) and doing coding challenges. After a long day, I like winding down by reading Sci-fi and/or by drawing.
