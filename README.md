## About me

 I am a gradute student in physics with an interest in cosmology. I am currently working with Professor <a href="https://sbird.github.io">Simeon Bird</a> . I am specifically exploring whether wavelet scatter transform can provide better ways for constraining cosmological parameters. Before that, I worked with Professor <a href="https://danielgrin.net">Daniel Grin</a> at Haverford College throughout my undergradute career. I analyzed time and spatial variation of the fine structure constant.
