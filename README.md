## About me
 


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97810883/206708712-66f84c3f-395c-42a6-80b9-6d98b1667222.jpg" float: right alt="" width="200" height="200"  /><div>I am a gradute student in physics with an interest in cosmology. I am currently working with [Professor Simeon Bird][Simeon-Bird]. I am specifically exploring whether wavelet scatter transform can provide better ways for constraining cosmological parameters. Before that, I worked with Professor Daniel Grin at Haverford College throughout my undergradute career. I analyzed time and spatial variation of the fine structure constant.</div>
