In the early universe, gravitational force of cold
dark matter tried to keep the baryon-photon plasma
contained. But since the universe was also extremely hot
and ionized there was outward pressure. This created
sound waves. The CMB photons allow us to see the
patterns that resulted from the oscillations of the sound
waves in early universe. The calculation method for power spectra in the
project was based on the idea that photons and baryons
were lightly coupled prior to recombination which allowed
a two fluid description of the perturbation. The analysis
was restricted to adiabatic perturbation based on Seljak et al 1994. I calculated the evolution of the source terms and approximated CMB anisotrpy for adiabatic process.
