I built a temperature controller that uses  a bridge circuit to find temperature difference. The output of the bridge circuit is sent through a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller to correct the error in temperature and giving a corrective action. The output from the PID controller is then amplified and sent to the  thermoelectric cooler to adjust temperature.
