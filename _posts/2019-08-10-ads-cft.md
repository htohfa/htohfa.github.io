We used Anti-de Sitter spacetime/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT)
correspondence to determine quantum field theory correlation functions—
expectation values of products of fields–—in two field theories, by performing a
calculation in the dual gravity theory. I.e., we compute the correlation functions
holographically. The first field theory is the canonical one. We solve the KleinGordon equation in Anti-de Sitter spacetime or asymptotically so which gives us
two independent solutions with undetermined coefficients. The path integral
depends on these coefficients, which correspond to a choice of boundary
condition on the AdS side and a choice of sources on the field theory side. On the
field theory side, the correlation functions coincide with derivatives of the path
integral with respect to the sources. We perform the corresponding dual gravity
calculation. After completing the calculation for the canonical AdS/CFT setting, we
perform the analogous computation for a novel field theory of interest in
condensed matter physics, which possesses a Lifshitz multicritical point.
