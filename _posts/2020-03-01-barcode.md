Lock-in amplication is a way of detecting signal from
a very noisy environment. In other words, it is a method
to single out the component of a signal at a specific reference frequency and phase. I built a barcode scanner using optical scanner. But the laser was too weak. So, I used lock in
amplifier to read the barcode and wrote a simple python program in Raspberry pi to decode the barcode.
