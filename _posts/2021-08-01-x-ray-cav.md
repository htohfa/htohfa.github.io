X-ray observations have shown that the wholesale cooling of the universe is
being offset by mechanical heating from active galactic nuclei(AGN).
Feedback and heating from AGN are considered a prime candidate for solving
the “cooling flow” problem in the hot gas of galaxy clusters. Recent
observations using Chandra telescope has produced detection of X-ray surface
brightness depressions known as “cavities” or “bubbles” in many of these
systems, interpreted as buoyantly rising bubbles created by AGN outbursts.
Studies of such cavities in clusters suggest that the outburst energy required to
inflate these cavities would be sufficient to balance cooling. The pressure from
these cavities have a one-to-one correlation with the luminosity of the clusters.
We have created simulations by imagining bubbles by varying their radii and
distance from the AGN center using different theoretical models and
experimental data of X-ray cavities. We then looked at their pressure and
corresponding luminosity of the clusters and found a similar correlation which
implies that correlation is rather a property of the gas cluster. So, the objects
that we observe as cavities might be just numerical noise in the telescope data
as the pressure-luminosity one-to-one correlation is not a cavity specific
property. We have also observed that scatter is dependent on the bubble
geometry. From previous experimental observations we have also noticed
correlation between radii and distance from AGN center. We have imposed
theoretical constraints to explain this phenomena as well.
