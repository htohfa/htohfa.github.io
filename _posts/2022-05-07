Observation of type Ia supernova has shown evidence for a univese that is expanding in accelerating rate. Before that, the expansion of the universe was expected to slow down at a rate determined by the density of matter and energy within it. This acceleration of expansion of the universe can be described if there is a negative pressure that works against gravity that is supposed to slow the expansion of the universe even at cosmological scales. There are few proposed forms of dark energy such as Einstein's cosmological constant which is a constant energy density filling space homogeneously or some sort of dynamic scalar field whose energy density can vary in space and time. In this project, I will be constraining a form of dark energy which is the scalar field and has power law potential. 
The simplest power law potential can be written as $V(\phi) = V_0 \phi^{-\alpha}$. I used a tracker model of dark energy: $$V = V_0 \mathrm{ coth}^{\alpha}(\frac{\lambda \phi}{M_{pl}})$$ and constrained $V_0$, $\alpha$ for supernova data using MCMC simulations.
