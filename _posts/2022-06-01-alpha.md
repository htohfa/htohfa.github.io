title:  "Fine Structure Constant Variation"
layout: post
---
In some extensions of the standard model of particle physics, the values of the funda- mental coupling constants could vary in space and time. In some string inspired scenarios, the couplings relate to the size of extra dimensions. Some recent observations of QSO hinted at possible time and spatial variation of the fine structure constant. We analyzed the Bekenstein-Sandvik-Barrow-Magueijo (BSBM) model which posits the existence of a cosmological scalar field and allows the field and the fine structure constant to evolve with the expansion of the universe as well as the string inspired model runaway dilaton. We explore which models are consistent with the CMB anisotropies measured by Planck and quasar observations.
