I am a gradute student in physics with an interest in cosmology. I am currently working with [Professor Simeon Bird][Simeon-Bird]. I am specifically exploring whether wavelet scatter transform can provide better ways for constraining cosmological parameters. Before that, I worked with Professor Daniel Grin at Haverford College throughout my undergradute career. I analyzed time and spatial variation of the fine structure constant.
