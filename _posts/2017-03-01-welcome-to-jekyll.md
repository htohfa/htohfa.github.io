I am a gradute student in physics with an interest in cosmology. I am currently working with [Professor-Simeon-Bird]: https://sbird.github.io. I am specifically exploring whether wavelet scatter transform can provide better ways for constraining cosmological parameters. 

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
